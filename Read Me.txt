Prerequisite: 'XAMPP' to run PHP files

Steps to run the website: 
Step 1: Save the folder in 'C:\xampp\htdocs' after installing xampp
Step 2: Run XAMPP, and Start 'Apache' and 'MySQL'
Step 3: Run 'http://localhost/phpmyadmin/' on your browser. 
Step 4: Go to 'Database' to create a new database 'musicrec' for our project
Step 5: Then, click on 'import' and select db.sql from our folder.
It should import successfully.
Step 6: pip install all the import libraries.

Step 8: On your broswer, run 'http://localhost/visual-analysis/' to run the website. 
There will be two options, visualizations and music. 
Visualizations will show the sentiment analysis of each song graphically.
And Music will show all the latest songs imported from the Billboard charts with a preview to listen to the song as well.
